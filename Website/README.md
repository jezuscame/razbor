### How to set up the project

Open the terminal in the project folder. Use these commands:

**npm install**

When you run the npm install command, NPM will look for a package.json file in your project's root directory to determine the dependencies and their versions that your project needs. It will then download and install these packages, along with any other packages that they depend on, into a node_modules directory within your project.

**npm start**

When you run the npm start command in the terminal, NPM will look for the start script in the package.json file and execute it. The script typically starts the application server or other processes needed for the application to run.
